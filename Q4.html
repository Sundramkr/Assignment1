<!--In HTML, a tag is a keyword or command enclosed in angle brackets
 (<>) that specifies how an element should be formatted or behave
  on a web page. Tags are used to structure and define the 
  elements on a web page. For example, <h1> is a tag used to 
    define a top-level heading, and <p> is a tag used to define 
        a paragraph.
    An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing 
    tag. For instance, the <p> element is composed of an opening 
        <p> tag, the text content, and a closing </p> tag. 
        Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document.
    
    Example of a tag: <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, etc.
    
    Example of an element: -->

    <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
