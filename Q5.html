<!--The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML is a declaration at the beginning 
of an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML being used.
 It tells the web browser how to interpret and render the web page.
  It does not require a closing tag and is placed at the very 
  beginning of an HTML document. For HTML5, the DOCTYPE 
  declaration is:  -->

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <!--It informs the browser that the document is written in HTML5, 
  the latest version of HTML at the time of this response. 
  The DOCTYPE declaration helps ensure that the web page is 
  displayed correctly and consistently across different browsers.  -->
